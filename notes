• We need someone to research conceptual uses of models. What are they good for? What are they not good for?

• Implement and understand Turchin's demographic structural math model. Ways to combine with asabiya model?

• Why would we want to apply models to history? This should be more abstract, theoretical. Then we move into our models.

• Notes from Turchin Introduction

– Theory in social science terms: qualitative

– in order to be a mature discipline, need mathematical theory

– Other fields which developed mathematical theories recently: synthetic theory of evolution; population ecology

– simple approaches inspired by physics will fail; too many interweaving parts; exogenous forces

– physicists have lots of data, and can gather data. Very untrue for historical sociologists.

– CHAOS

– dynamics: change over time

– dynamic systems approach: break up larger thing into smaller pieces that interact with each other

– imperial dynamics: territory, number of people change over time

– all models simplify reality. Artificiality. Many models are wrong (have wrong assumptions), but still useful. 

• Collective Solidarity Notes

– “the best organized group usually wins, and that means the group with the most internal solidarity” (Collins 1992:26) page 37 from Turchin

– Ibn Khaldun: Asabiyagoo

– small scale societies lead to increased asabiya because collective action is necessary for survival

– empires lead to decreased asabiya because of luxuries, intraelite competition

– McNeill 1963: “a long line of lords marcher who created empires by successfully exploiting a strategic position on the frontier between civilization and barbarism.”

– Durkheim's Mechanical solidarity. Disregard organic since we're looking at agrarian empires, not industrial.
